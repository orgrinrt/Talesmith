# Talesmith
Talesmith proof-of-concept productivity application created with Godot.

Very early on in development, nothing of substance done yet. Basically has
some initial sketches of how the UI should work.

This is a cross-platform client aimed to make the core features more 
dynamic and fluid to use. A windows client was previously done but
it's unfinished and abandoned because it was not done in a way that would
have allowed for the core to be used in other clients, thus dooming the
project to only ever allow a windows client. This had to change, so here
we are.

UPDATE: 14.7.2020

Using Godot is fun, but it may be overkill for a productivity app.

Looking to create a single core lib with logical api and making native clients for each platform. In the meantime, this project is frozen temporarily.
